# contact-form-ajax
Contact Form AJAX is a lightweight project that enables seamless form submission without page reloads. It collects user inputs like name, email, subject, and message, validates them in real time, and sends data to the server via AJAX. The server processes the request and dynamically returns success or error feedback.
